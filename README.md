# Salmonella-enteric

Foodborne illness caused by a variety of contaminated foods and beverages continue to pose a major global public health problem. In the US, 48 million (about 1 in 6) people get infected due to foodborne illness, resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths each year. GenomeTrakr Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Network, provided by the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), is then used as a common tool concerning the food safety. Salmonella enterica is one of the pathogens causing foodborne illness with the most infected individuals. Many studies have investigated the foodborne outbreak caused by Salmonella enteritidis using WGS approach. 

In this project, we will primarily concentrate on Salmonella enterica serovar detection to see if it can give us some information to identify the outbreak and potential transmission trend.
